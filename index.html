        <p class="headingPara">We help our clients meet their quotas
            when it is most difficult to do so.
            Sometimes, warehouses don't have enough drivers to prevent rollover freight, but with Hermes Go, managers
            can easily request extra drivers on demand.</p>

                    Drivers often resort to dangerously
                    juggling up to three phone apps while
                    driving in order to scan packages, op-
                    timize routes, and navigate to the
                    destination. We will not only use the
                    best scanning and route optimizing
                    companies in the industry but also
                    allow drivers to manage and record
                    their day to day activities to make life
                    easier.
